          About Me
        </h1>
        <p className="p-me2">
          I have a BA in theology and philosophy, and was a logic teacher in my
          country when I discovered my passion for technology. when I discovered
          my passion for technology. I needed to learn computer skills to become
          a registrar at my school, and I found it fascinating. I learned MCSE
          and MCSA and even built two websites for a real estate and
          agricultural company and sat up two Computer workshops in a high
          school.
          <br />
          After moving to New Zealand, I decided to enroll in Dev Academy to
          expand my knowledge further. It was an intensive course, but I loved
          every moment of it. I constantly learned new technologies through
          individual, pair and group projects. In addition to technical skills,
          I also gained valuable human skills, including teamwork, active
          listening, conflict resolution, giving and receiving feedback,
          collaborative and problem-solving.
          <br />
          <b>w</b>hat I loved most was discovering myself more and finding out
          how fast I can learn, how hard I work, and how dedicated I am to what
          I believe in. I also realized that I am good at structural thinking
          and design , which helps me approach problems with creativity and
          strategic planning.
          <br />
          I am an energetic person and always eager to learn and improve my
          skills. And I believe that my tech and human skills, along with my
          passion for continuous improvement, will enable me to succeed, and I
          want to find an opportunity in technology to continue improving my
          skills and pursuing my passion.
